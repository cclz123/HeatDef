The source code implements the saliency computation algorithm described in our submission.

Requirement:
1.Visual Studio 2010 x64 enviroument
2.CUDA 4.0. 
The default installation path of CUDA is: "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v4.0\",
otherwise, the INCLUDE pathes for CUDA in ContourLineMex.cpp and ContourDescriptorMex.cpp should be changed accordingly.

How to run:
